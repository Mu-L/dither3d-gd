# Surface-Stable Fractal Dithering for Godot

This project is a port of [Dither3D](https://github.com/runevision/Dither3D) to Godot Engine, packaged as a plugin.

## Features

- **Surface-Stable Fractal Dithering**: Dots stick to surfaces and maintain constant screen size.
- **Multiple Shaders**:
  - `Dither3DOpaque.gdshader`: Standard opaque material.
  - `Dither3DCutout.gdshader`: Alpha cutout support.
  - `Dither3DParticleAdd.gdshader`: Additive particles.
  - `Dither3DSkybox.gdshader`: Skybox shader (6-sided texture support).
  - **Global Variants**: All shaders have a "Global" version (e.g., `Dither3DOpaqueGlobal.gdshader`) that uses project-wide settings.
- **Global Settings Panel**:
  - A dedicated bottom panel in the editor to control dither parameters globally.
  - Changes are applied in real-time and saved to `ProjectSettings`.
  - Supports switching between Local (per-material) and Global control.
- **Scene Converter Tool**:
  - Automatically creates a copy of any scene with Dither3D materials applied.
  - Supports generating both Local (independent) and Global (linked to project settings) versions.
- **Ready-to-use Materials**:
  - `materials/dither3d-opaque-default.tres`: A pre-configured material using the opaque shader. You can drop this directly onto your geometry to see the effect immediately.
- **Texture Generator**: Generate required 3D textures within the editor.
